= List of Major Changes to Magento =

=== File System Change ===

In Magento, class names directly mapped to sub-directories and file names.  So a class like 

  X_Y_Z

was located in a directory 

  mage/x/y/z.php  

(capitalization removed for this explanation)

This might seem rationale with the above example, but when you have very long class names like:

  Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Abstract

It can get confusing to constantly be changed directories for no other reason than class names.  Plus, in your IDE or text editor, when the file names are exceedingly long you will only see the beginning and end.  So, if you are tracking down a problem you may have 3-4 files opened which are just labeled "Abstract.php".

Agent-Ohm changes the file layout to pivot of the major "kinds" of classes:  Models, Blocks, Helpers, Controllers.  In Agento-Ohm a class like

  X_Y_Z

Will be in a directory like

  mage/x/y_z.php

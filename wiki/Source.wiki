The Agent-Ohm source code is in a git repository and the main repository is currently hosted on github.com 

[http://github.com/markkimsal/agent-ohm/tree/master github home]

==How do I make my own AO checkout to try?==
1. Install git

{{{
  git clone git://github.com/markkimsal/agent-ohm.git
}}}

You will get a directory called "agent-ohm".  That's it.


==How do I make my own AO checkout that I can customize but still keep up to date?==

  # Follow step 1 from the previous question
  # git checkout -b mycustomchanges
  #  .... do your custom changes.

To keep up to date:

  # git status (make sure it's clean)
  # git checkout master
  # git pull origin
  # git checkout mycustomchanges (no -b this time)
  # git rebase master
